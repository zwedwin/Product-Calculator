This is a repository containing files for a botique app I created to post files to our compoany store.
The McNultyBrowser contains python code which via selenium scrapes the webpage for all relevant information. It handles all "back-end" code.
The GUI is implemented with tkinter, this is the "front-end."
This code was implemented on windows so has some driver and explicit file path dependencies which make distribution a challenge but I have exported the package to some coworkers.
